# Munchkin Care

### Munchkin Care is an application for parents to find caregivers for their children or caregivers to find families to whome they can lend their services.
Munchkin Care is the semester long project for UIC's CS 422 User Interface course.  The application was created using primarily `JavaScript`, `HTML`, and `CSS`.
